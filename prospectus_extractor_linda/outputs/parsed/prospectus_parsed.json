This Supplement forms part of the Prospectus of the ICAV dated 13 May 2024 (the Prospectus) and should be read in the context of and together with the Prospectus. Save as disclosed in this Supplement, there has been no significant change and no significant new matter has arisen since publication of the Prospectus. The Directors of the ICAV whose names appear in the section entitled Directors of the ICAV in the Prospectus accept responsibility for the information contained in this document. To the best of the knowledge and belief of the Directors (who have taken all reasonable care to ensure such is the case) the information contained in this document is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information. Words and expressions defined in the Prospectus shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the same meaning when used in this Supplement. Shares purchased on the secondary market cannot usually be sold directly back to the Sub-Fund. Investors must buy and sell Shares on a secondary market with the assistance of an intermediary (e.g. a stockbroker) and may incur fees for doing so. In addition, investors may pay more than the current Net Asset Value when buying Shares and may receive less than the current Net Asset Value per Share when selling them. The value of Shares may go down as well as up and investors may not get back any of the amount invested. Prospective investors should review this Supplement and the Prospectus carefully in their entirety and consider the Risk Factors set out in the Prospectus and in this Supplement before investing in this Sub-Fund.",

    "content": "Investment objective The investment objective is to achieve long-term capital growth by investing in a portfolio of US equity securities. Investment policy The Sub-Fund is actively managed, and, in order to achieve its investment objective, the Sub-Fund will invest, in a manner consistent with the UCITS Regulations and Central Bank requirements, at least 70% of its net assets in equities which are constituents of the S&P 500 Index (USD, NR) (the Benchmark) and up to 30% of its net assets in the equities of issuers whose registered office is not located in the US. The Sub-Fund will invest no more than 10% of its net asset in issuers whose registered office is not located in a country of the OECD. The Sub-Fund may invest up to 30% of its net assets in investment grade fixed or floating rate bonds issued by corporate or sovereign issuers. An investment grade rating is a classification of BBB- or above by Standard & Poor or the deemed equivalent by the Investment Manager or the Investment Manager’s internal rating. For the avoidance of doubt, investors should note that the Sub-Fund will not seek to track the performance of, or replicate, the Benchmark. Rather the Sub-Fund will provide exposure to a portfolio of equity securities issued by large and mid-capitalisation companies. The Sub-Fund may invest in ancillary liquid assets and money market instruments which may include bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, floating rate notes and freely transferable promissory notes. Investors should also note that the Sub-Fund may invest in ETFs established as collective investment schemes and authorised as UCITS in pursuit of its investment objective, subject to the investment restrictions outlined in the Prospectus. The transferable securities, ancillary liquid assets, money market instruments and FDI (other than permitted unlisted investments) held by the Sub-Fund will be listed or traded on the Regulated Markets referred to in Appendix 1 of the Prospectus. Investment Process The selection of equity securities for the Sub-Fund is performed using the Investment Manager’s proprietary quantitative trend-following model. The quantitative model rates all in scope US equities (being mainly comprised of the constituents of the Benchmark) using a momentum strategy (selecting equities which are performing well and expected to continue to do so) by analysing extensive historical data to detect stable momentum trends in the market. The portfolio construction process is optimised in order to build a high-momentum portfolio under various risk management constraints (being … [Oddo to elaborate]). The selected portfolio is then subject to the ESG investment process described below. ESG Investment Process The Investment Manager will consider current and future sustainability activities of issuers and sustainability opportunities/risks when making investment decisions, as well as the significant negative impact",

    "content": "of investment decisions on sustainability factors. This is based on internal research and the use of data and research from third parties. The Sub-Fund will exclude securities on the basis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, using the ESG ratings produced and monitoring of controversies by MSCI (the MSCI ESG Rating) or another source of information deemed acceptable to the Investment Manager. MSCI ESG Ratings are designed to measure companies’ resilience to long-term, industry-specific ESG risks and opportunities. The MSCI ESG Rating methodology uses a rules-based methodology by assigning companies an industry-relative letter rating from AAA to CCC based on how well they manage these risks and opportunities relative their peers. Subject and as further defined in the ESG exclusion policy of the Investment Manager published on am.oddo-bhf.com, the Sub-Fund will exclude issuers involved in the manufacture and distribution of non-conventional weapons, tobacco or of coal development projects or infrastructure. Issuers in other controversial business sectors are excluded if a certain turnover threshold is exceeded. These include coal mining (5% of turnover or more than 8 million tons), coal-fired power generation (15% of production mix or installed capacity), fossil fuel extraction in the Arctic (10% of turnover) and palm oil production (5% of turnover) as well as any company involved in serious controversies linked to biodiversity. In addition, issuers from the following sectors are excluded if more than 5% of their revenue is generated from the exploration, production and use of unconventional oil and gas (shale oil/gas and oil sands). Issuers that significantly violate the principles of the United Nations Global Compact (the UNGC) or the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are also excluded. The Investment manager will rely on MSCI’s data to determine whether companies are considered to have significantly violated the UNGC principles and/or OECD Guidelines. It is anticipated that at least 90% of the Sub-Fund’s net assets will be invested in securities with an ESG rating (accounting for the weight of each security). The Investment Manager will construct the portfolio with an average ESG score better than the average ESG score of the Benchmark. This results in positive bias for issuers with lower sustainability risks, employing a best-in-class approach. Sustainability risks The Sub-Fund promotes environmental and social characteristics and qualifies as a financial product subject to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (as may be amended from time to time) (SFDR). The Sub-Fund promotes environmental characteristics by excluding companies involved in controversial business sectors if a certain turnover threshold is exceeded.

    "content": "Standards under the section entitled Risk Factors of the Prospectus. Further disclosures in relation to the application of the SFDR are set out in the Annex to this Supplement. A sustainability risk in this context means an ESG event or condition that, if it occurs, could cause an actual or a potential material negative impact on the value of the investment (Sustainability Risk). The Investment Manager integrates the consideration of Sustainability Risks into the investment process through the use of ESG ratings and application of mandatory exclusions. The Manager, in conjunction with the Investment Manager, has assessed the likely impacts of Sustainability Risks on the returns of the Sub-Fund, and considers it unlikely that Sustainability Risks will have a material impact on the returns of the Sub-Fund. Use of financial derivative instruments and efficient portfolio management Investors should note that the Sub-Fund may also invest in Financial Derivative Instruments (FDIs) for efficient portfolio management and/or hedging purposes. The Sub-Fund may use FDIs such as futures, options and forward contracts which are described in the section entitled Use of Financial Derivative Instruments and Efficient Portfolio Management in the Prospectus. This may on occasions lead to an increase in the risk profile of the Sub-Fund or result in a fluctuation in the expected level of volatility. Please see the section entitled Risk Factors in the Prospectus in relation to such risks. The Sub-Fund will employ the commitment approach to assess the Sub-Fund's global exposure and to ensure that the Sub-Fund's use of derivative instruments is within the limits specified by the Central Bank. Global exposure will be calculated daily. The Sub-Fund will not be leveraged through the use of FDIs. Investment in FDIs is subject to the conditions and limits contained in the Central Bank UCITS Regulations issued by the Central Bank. Subject to these limits, the Sub-Fund may invest in FDIs dealt on any of the regulated markets set out in the list of Regulated Markets in Appendix 1 to the Prospectus (and/or over the counter FDIs (OTCs)) which will be used for investment, efficient portfolio management and/or for hedging purposes. The ICAV employs a risk management process which enables it to accurately measure, monitor and manage at any time the various risks associated with FDIs and their contribution to the overall risk profile of the portfolio of assets of the Sub-Fund. The ICAV will, on request, provide supplementary information to Shareholders relating to the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative limits that are applied and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of the main categories of investments. The Sub-Fund will only invest in FDIs in accordance with the risk management policy filed with the Central Bank.",

The following risks relate specifically to the Sub-Fund: Investment Strategy Risk There is a risk that third party data provided by external data providers may be inaccurate. Sustainable investing may mitigate security-specific risk however the screens used in connection with sustainable investing reduce the investable universe, which may limit the opportunities and may increase the risk of loss during market declines. Active Management Risk The Sub-Fund’s assets will be actively managed by the Investment Manager who will have discretion (subject to the Sub-Fund’s investment restrictions) to invest the Sub-Fund’s assets in investments that it considers will enable the Sub-Fund to achieve its investment objective. There is no guarantee that the Sub-Fund’s investment objective will be achieved based on the investments selected. Quantitative Model Risk There can be no assurance that the use of the quantitative model will result in the Sub-Fund achieving its investment objective. The Investment Manager will apply the model to in scope US equities to construct the portfolio and to manage the overall portfolio risk. The final selection of companies for inclusion in the portfolio will depend on a variety of factors, such as the quality and accuracy of data inputs and the successful integration of the quantitative models. Any errors or limitations in the systematic quantitative models may result in different outcomes to those anticipated by the Investment Manager. Such models that have been formulated on the basis of past market data may not be predictive of future price movements and may not be reliable if unusual or disruptive events cause market moves, the nature or size of which are inconsistent with the historic performance of individual markets. The use of the quantitative model techniques also present the risk that errors may go undetected for a long period of time. Such errors might never be detected or might be detected only after the Sub-Fund has sustained a loss (or reduced performance). Quantitative investment techniques also require timely and efficient execution of transactions as failure to do so may result in lost profits for the Sub-Fund.",

In addition, investors in ETF Classes may pay more than the current Net Asset Value when buying Shares and may receive less than the current Net Asset Value when selling them. Investors can otherwise subscribe for or redeem Creation Units in accordance with the procedures set out in the section entitled Primary Market in the Prospectus.

The exclusions are the following: Unconventional weapons: all companies that manufacture or distribute weapons prohibited under the abovementioned international conventions. Companies shall have no activity of manufacturing or of manufacturing tailor-made components, using, repairing, putting up for sale, selling, distributing, importing or exporting, storing or transporting controversial or indiscriminate weapons such as: anti-personnel mines, submunitions, inert ammunition and armour containing depleted uranium or any other industrial uranium, weapons containing white phosphorus, biological, chemical or nuclear weapons (in the case of companies incorporated in a country that does not form part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty). Coal mining: Any company with an annual production in excess of 8 million tonnes or, alternatively, a production equivalent to 5% of its revenues. Coal power: Any company for which coal accounts for more than 15% of its production mix or, alternatively, more than 15% of its installed capacity. Coal development projects: Any company engaged in coal mining or coal-fired power generation that is developing new projects involving thermal coal, regardless of the project’s size. This includes coal infrastructure projects such as port or road developments favouring the development of coal production. Tobacco: all companies that generate more than 0% of their revenues from the production of tobacco. Unconventional oil and gas: all companies from the energy sector that generate more than 5% of their revenues from the extraction and production of unconventional oil and gas. This includes shale oil and gas as well as oil sands. Arctic exploration: all companies from the energy sector that generate more than 10% of their revenues from the extraction and production of (conventional and unconventional) oil and gas in the Arctic. Governance and international norms and conventions: all companies violating the United Nations Global Compact as well as OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Biodiversity: all companies that generate more than 5% of their revenues from the production of palm oil as well as any company involved in serious controversies linked to biodiversity.

The selection of equity securities for the Sub-Fund is performed using the Investment Manager’s proprietary quantitative trend-following model. The quantitative model rates all stocks in the investment universe based on a momentum strategy analysing extensive historical data to detect stable trends in the market. The portfolio construction process involves an optimization in order to build a high-momentum portfolio under various risk management constraints. Apart from the ESG screening and placing orders for purchases or sales of securities performed by the Investment Manager, there is no manual intervention in the model’s investment decisions. As part of the Investment Manager’s strategy to promote environmental and social characteristics, the current and future material sustainability-related impacts, risks, and opportunities of issuers will be integrated into investment decisions. Significant negative impact of investment decisions on sustainability factors will also be taken into account. The investment process is based on ESG integration, ESG ratings, normative and sector exclusions (including UNGC and controversial weapons) and positive selection. In addition, the Investment Manager will observe the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment with respect to ESG issues and will apply them in its commitments by actively exercising shareholder and creditor rights. The investment process consists of two stages. The first is based on sector-based exclusions and the exclusion of controversial activities.
