Article 6: The management team does not consider sustainability risks or adverse effects of investment decisions on sustainability factors in the investment decision making process. Article 8: The management team addresses sustainability risks by integrating ESG criteria (Environment and/or Social and/or Governance) into its investment decision making process. Article 9: The management team follows a strict sustainable investment objective that significantly contributes to the challenges of the ecological transition, and addresses Sustainability Risks through ratings provided by the Management Company’s external ESG data provider.\n- 2 The summary risk indicator (SRI) is a guide to the level of risk of this product compared to other products. It shows how likely it is that the product will lose money because of movements in the markets or because we are not able to pay you. It scales in a range from 1 (lowest risk) to 7 (highest risk). The lowest category does not mean a risk-free investment. This indicator is not constant and is updated if the risk profile of the fund changes over time. Historical data, such as is used to calculate the risk indicator, may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile of the Fund. There is no guarantee that the management objectives in terms of risk will actually be met. The risk indicator assumes you keep the product until the end of the recommended holding period. The actual risk can vary significantly if you cash in at an early stage and you may get back less.",

Annualised performance is calculated on an actuarial basis on an annual basis over 365 days. Differences in the performance of a fund relative to its benchmark are arithmetic differences. Statistical indicators are generally calculated on a weekly basis on Fridays, or the previous valuation day failing that.\nActive Share\nMeasure of the percentage of securities in the portfolio that differs from the benchmark. A higher active share implies a greater difference in portfolio allocation vs the benchmark.\nJensen’s alpha\nMeasure of the performance gap between the portfolio and the benchmark with a similar level of risk (adjusted for β). It measures the value of the fund or the manager’s ability to “beat the market”, also known as excess return.\nBeta\nβ measures the sensitivity of the performance of a portfolio compared with that of its benchmark, i.e., when the bench- mark varies by X%, the fund varies, on average, by a magnitude equal to β*X%.\nCorrelation coefficient\nThe correlation coefficient defines the degree of dependence between change in the performance of the portfolio and that of its benchmark. The closer it is to 1, the greater the degree of dependence. A negative correlation coefficient means that, on average, the portfolio will fluctuate inversely to its benchmark.\nDuration\nDuration is a measure of interest rate risk in bond instruments. Duration is expressed as the weighted average life of all flows (interest and principal).\nDistance to bond floor\nFor convertible bonds, the value of the bond component. The distance to the bond floor represents the value of the conversion option into shares.\nMaximum Drawdown\nThe maximum drawdown is the level of loss (in %) recorded on a fund during the worst period of decline over the period under review.\nAverage maturity\nAverage life is defined as the weighted average maturity (in years) of all the cash flows (including repayment of the of capital) resulting from an investment. Therefore, it is a question a measuring instrument allowing to assess the sensitivity of the price of an asset or a portfolio at a change in interest rates.\nSharpe Ratio\nThe Sharpe ratio measures the risk/return profile of the portfolio or benchmark. It is the difference between the annualised performance of the fund (or its benchmark) and the annual return based on the risk-free rate divided by the volatility of the fund (or its benchmark).\nInformation ratio\nThe information ratio measures the over/under performance achieved by the manager when he or she deviates from the reference indicator It is equal to the difference in the annualized portfolio return by relative to its reference indicator, divided by the tracking error.\nRecovery Delay\nPayback period of maximum drawdown: the time to clear the loss on the worst period of decline and return to the original level.\n\nNotes:\n- 32",

The value of the portfolio is subject to change in the event of deterioration or improvement in the quality of issuers. Thus, a value of +2% for instance means that for an instantaneous 1% increase (respectively decrease) in spreads, the portfolio value would decrease (in- crease) by 2%.\nInterest rate sensitivity\nFor convertible bonds, interest rate sensitivity measures the percentage change in value induced by a change in the interest rate.\nCredit spread\nThe credit spread refers to the risk premium, or the difference between the yields on corporate bonds and government bonds with similar characteristics.\nTurnover rate\nThe portfolio turnover rate is the sum of movements (purchases and sales of securities), less the amount of subscriptions/redemptions, based on the average net assets observed over the period.\nTracking-Error\nMeasure of the relative risk taken by a fund vs its benchmark. The tracking error is the volatility of relative performance, i.e. the annualised standard deviation of the arithmetic over- or underperformance of the portfolio vs its benchmark.\nWeighted Average Life (WAL)\nFor money market funds: weighted average life of the portfolio until the date of termination of financial instruments.\nWeighted Average Maturity (WAM)\nWeighted average maturity of the portfolio: measure of sensitivity of money market funds to interest rate risk.\nEx-post Value at Risk (VaR)\nEx-post VaR is the maximum loss recorded by an investor factoring in an investment period and a confidence interval. Thus, a daily 1-year VaR of x% calculated with a confidence interval of 99% means that, over an observation period of 1 year, only 1% of daily performances were below x%.\nVolatility\nVolatility is a risk indicator that measures the magnitude of the variation of a portfolio (or benchmark) over a given period. It is calculated as the annualised standard deviation of absolute returns over a defined period.\n\nNotes:\n- 33",
