The value of the portfolio is subject to change in the event of deterioration or improvement in the quality of issuers. Thus, a value of +2% for instance means that for an instantaneous 1% increase (respectively decrease) in spreads, the portfolio value would decrease (in- crease) by 2%.\nInterest rate sensitivity\nFor convertible bonds, interest rate sensitivity measures the percentage change in value induced by a change in the interest rate.\nCredit spread\nThe credit spread refers to the risk premium, or the difference between the yields on corporate bonds and government bonds with similar characteristics.\nTurnover rate\nThe portfolio turnover rate is the sum of movements (purchases and sales of securities), less the amount of subscriptions/redemptions, based on the average net assets observed over the period.\nTracking-Error\nMeasure of the relative risk taken by a fund vs its benchmark. The tracking error is the volatility of relative performance, i.e. the annualised standard deviation of the arithmetic over- or underperformance of the portfolio vs its benchmark.\nWeighted Average Life (WAL)\nFor money market funds: weighted average life of the portfolio until the date of termination of financial instruments.\nWeighted Average Maturity (WAM)\nWeighted average maturity of the portfolio: measure of sensitivity of money market funds to interest rate risk.\nEx-post Value at Risk (VaR)\nEx-post VaR is the maximum loss recorded by an investor factoring in an investment period and a confidence interval. Thus, a daily 1-year VaR of x% calculated with a confidence interval of 99% means that, over an observation period of 1 year, only 1% of daily performances were below x%.\nVolatility\nVolatility is a risk indicator that measures the magnitude of the variation of a portfolio (or benchmark) over a given period. It is calculated as the annualised standard deviation of absolute returns over a defined period.\n\nNotes:\n- 33", "metadata": {"slide_number": 33, "slide_title": "GlossarY of Terms (2/2)", "has_charts": false, "has_tables": false, "has_images": false, "element_count": 11, "footnote_count": 1, "total_slides": 35}},
