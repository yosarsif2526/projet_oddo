Annualised performance is calculated on an actuarial basis on an annual basis over 365 days. Differences in the performance of a fund relative to its benchmark are arithmetic differences. Statistical indicators are generally calculated on a weekly basis on Fridays, or the previous valuation day failing that.\nActive Share\nMeasure of the percentage of securities in the portfolio that differs from the benchmark. A higher active share implies a greater difference in portfolio allocation vs the benchmark.\nJensen’s alpha\nMeasure of the performance gap between the portfolio and the benchmark with a similar level of risk (adjusted for β). It measures the value of the fund or the manager’s ability to “beat the market”, also known as excess return.\nBeta\nβ measures the sensitivity of the performance of a portfolio compared with that of its benchmark, i.e., when the bench- mark varies by X%, the fund varies, on average, by a magnitude equal to β*X%.\nCorrelation coefficient\nThe correlation coefficient defines the degree of dependence between change in the performance of the portfolio and that of its benchmark. The closer it is to 1, the greater the degree of dependence. A negative correlation coefficient means that, on average, the portfolio will fluctuate inversely to its benchmark.\nDuration\nDuration is a measure of interest rate risk in bond instruments. Duration is expressed as the weighted average life of all flows (interest and principal).\nDistance to bond floor\nFor convertible bonds, the value of the bond component. The distance to the bond floor represents the value of the conversion option into shares.\nMaximum Drawdown\nThe maximum drawdown is the level of loss (in %) recorded on a fund during the worst period of decline over the period under review.\nAverage maturity\nAverage life is defined as the weighted average maturity (in years) of all the cash flows (including repayment of the of capital) resulting from an investment. Therefore, it is a question a measuring instrument allowing to assess the sensitivity of the price of an asset or a portfolio at a change in interest rates.\nSharpe Ratio\nThe Sharpe ratio measures the risk/return profile of the portfolio or benchmark. It is the difference between the annualised performance of the fund (or its benchmark) and the annual return based on the risk-free rate divided by the volatility of the fund (or its benchmark).\nInformation ratio\nThe information ratio measures the over/under performance achieved by the manager when he or she deviates from the reference indicator It is equal to the difference in the annualized portfolio return by relative to its reference indicator, divided by the tracking error.\nRecovery Delay\nPayback period of maximum drawdown: the time to clear the loss on the worst period of decline and return to the original level.\n\nNotes:\n- 32", "metadata": {"slide_number": 32, "slide_title": "GLOSSARY OF TERMS (1/2)", "has_charts": false, "has_tables": false, "has_images": false, "element_count": 12, "footnote_count": 1, "total_slides": 35}},
