    "Additional information for very specific marketing information produced for the German market": "If ODDO BHF Asset Management GmbH receives any rebates on the management fee of target funds or other assets, ODDO BHF Asset Management GmbH undertakes to fully remit such payment to the investor or the fund. If ODDO BHF Asset Management GmbH performs services for an investment product of a third party, ODDO BHF Asset Management GmbH will be compensated by the relevant company. Typical services are investment management or sales activities for funds established by a different investment management company. Normally, such compensation is calculated as a percentage of the management fee (up to 100%) of the respective fund, calculated on the basis of such fund’s assets managed or distributed by ODDO BHF Asset Management GmbH. This may result in the risk that the investment advice given may not be consistent with the investor’s interest. The amount of the management fee is published in the prospectus of the respective fund. Further details are available upon request. It is further intended solely for persons based in countries in which the respective funds are registered for distribution or in which such registration is not required. The shares of the fund have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”); they may therefore not be publicly offered or sold in the United States of America or to US citizens or any US residents. This publication is intended as marketing instrument and does not satisfy the statutory requirements regarding the impartiality of a financial analysis, and the financial instruments concerned are not subject to any prohibition of trading in advance of the publication of this presentation.",
